# CAN Arduino Nodes

Simple, low cost add-on node examples to supplement MDF data recorded on a [CSS Electronics CANEdge2](https://www.csselectronics.com/screen/product/can-lin-logger-wifi-canedge2/language/en).

Extending your CAN data collection with COTS components:

- Add additional buttons or digital IO.
- Add analog sensors.
- Add I^(2)C or SPI devices to the CAN bus.

# Getting Started:

## Hardware:

- [Arduino Uno R3](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3)
- [CAN-BUS Shield](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/CAN-BUS_Shield_V1.2/)
- [CAN Logger/Interface](https://www.csselectronics.com/screen/page/can-logger-products)
- [SocketCAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SocketCAN) device for testing.

# Projects

- [00: Blink](00_Blink): Simple project to test tool chain setup.
- [01: CAN Send]: cd 0

# Built With:

- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/): An open-source hardware and software company, project and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices.
- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/): A new generation ecosystem for embedded development.
- [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/) is a real-time operating system kernel for embedded devices that has been ported to 35 microcontroller platforms. It is distributed under the MIT License.   [[SAFERTOS](https://freertos.org/FreeRTOS-Plus/Safety_Critical_Certified/SafeRTOS.html) is based on the functional model of the FreeRTOS kernel]
